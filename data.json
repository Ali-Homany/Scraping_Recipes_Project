the oven to 350 degrees.","Mix butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and egg yolk until combined.","Stir in flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. When a soft dough has formed, stir in the chocolate chips.","Roll the dough into two balls and place on a baking sheet \u2013 there should be plenty for two large cookies plus a little bit of dough for a snack. (You\u2019re welcome.) You can add more chocolate chips to the top of the cookies if you want.","Bake for 10-12 minutes, depending on your oven temp and desired level of gooey cookie center.","Rest the cookies for a few minutes so they settle down and solidify a bit \u2013\u00a0 I set a timer for 10-15 minutes and just let them rest right on the pan. At that point they should be able to transfer to a plate, or maybe even held in your hand, for warm, delicious eating on the couch. Yum, yum, yum."],"1":["Sauce Base:Heat a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the butter, garlic, and tomato paste; saut\u00e9 for a few minutes until it\u2019s all soft and fragrant.","Add Cream, Broth, and Thyme:Add the cream; whisk to get the tomato paste smooth. Add the broth and thyme sprigs; simmer for 10-15 minutes to thicken the sauce until it reduces and clings to the back of a spoon. (If you\u2019re using the air fryer chicken, now is a good time to start that.)","Add Tomatoes and Chicken:Pop your drained diced tomatoes in the sauce and stir them in. Tuck the cooked chicken into the sauce and spoon a bit of sauce over the top.","You\u2019re Done! Yum.Sprinkle some thyme, parsley, or basil over the top to make it look pretty. Serve the pieces of chicken with spoonfuls of the sauce over rice, noodles, or mashed potatoes (personal fave) and a side salad for a beautiful, mega delicious meal."],"2":["Mix The Batter:In a medium size mixing bowl, whisk the nutritional yeast, cornstarch, soy sauce, oil, and spices into a batter. It should be fairly loose and runny.","Coat The Tofu:Tear the tofu into chunks and place them directly into the batter bowl. Using a wide spatula, gently toss the tofu in tbe batter until it\u2019s entirely coated.","Air Fry: Air fry at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes (see Note 5). Stop and give it a shake. And now air fry at 400 again for another 5 minutes until you reach your desired level of golden crispiness!","Sauce and Serve:To serve, toss the tofu your favorite sauce for a recipe (curries! stir fries! rice bowls!) or just pop these guys into some dipping sauce like a little nugget. Incredible."],"3":["Brown the sausage:Heat a very large oven-safe skillet over medium high heat. Add the oil and the sausage; break apart with a wooden spoon and brown until it\u2019s got some nice color. Transfer to a bowl and drain out any of the oil that you don\u2019t want (I usually drain off about a tablespoon, leaving a tablespoon in the pan).","Saut\u00e9 the veggies:If you\u2019ve got some browning on the bottom of your pan \u2013 great. Add the veggies and they should start to pull up some of that yummy brown flavor. Add the fennel seeds. Cook until the veggies are fragrant and soft \u2013 you can add a bit of salt or oil if you\u2019re feeling chefy. Then add the sausage back in.","Add everything else:Add your tomato sauce, your tortellini, and 1 cup of broth. The pan will be full. Let it come to a low simmer and cook for 5 minutes or so to cook the tortellini. If you need more liquid to cook the tortellini, go ahead and add some or all of the remaining broth. Sometimes I just pop a lid on and leave it for a while on low heat.","Spinach and cheese:Give it a taste \u2013 if you used canned tomatoes instead of a jar of sauce, it will probably need some salt. Add the spinach and stir it in until it wilts. Top the whole thing with the mozzarella cheese and pop it into the oven at 375 for 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese is nice and melty.","Finish:Sprinkle some grated parm on top along with some chopped parsley, and dunk into that baby with some chunks of garlic bread. SO GOOD."],"4":["Roast the cauliflower:Toss the cauliflower with the avocado oil, cumin, garam masala, curry powder, smoked paprika, and salt. Roast at 425 \/ 20 minutes in the air fryer, or 425 \/ 30 minutes in the oven until nice and roasty and golden.","Make the mint sauce:Blitz everything up until it\u2019s nice and smooth. I like to really blend this one so it\u2019s less chunky and more of a smooth green sauce.","Butter sauce time:Add butter sauce and chickpeas to a large skillet. Smash the chickpeas lightly with a potato masher to give a more interesting texture if you want (I do want). Add cauliflower back in.","Serve:Serve the butter cauliflower on rice and top with the mint sauce. Add pickled onions if you want. ENJOY!"],"5":["Tomato Salad:Toss the tomato cucumber salad ingredients together. Taste and adjust! (If you wanted to prep ahead, save the chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onion in separate containers in the fridge with no liquids added until just before serving.)","Sauce:Stir up the sauce ingredients. Taste and adjust! This keeps super well in the fridge for several days.","Chicken and Banza:Make the chicken and the banza (or whatever carb you like).","You\u2019re Done! Yum!Assemble and serve! Gah! So good."],"6":["Cut the the chicken into thin pieces:Cut each chicken breast into thin, flat pieces (not bite-sized but something that looks like a thin chicken breast). For example: if a one-pound package gives me two chicken breasts, I\u2019m often cutting it into 3-4 thin pieces per breast. Thin chicken is essential! And delicious! Pat the chicken breasts dry if they have a lot of moisture on them.","Coat the chicken with spices:Toss the spices together so they\u2019re mixed well; sprinkle mixture over the chicken pieces in a bowl. Add the oil and toss (I use my hands but tongs will work). You want to thoroughly coat the chicken. You can give it a short rest if you want, but I find that the flavor is excellent even if it just goes straight into the air fryer, and that\u2019s how I usually make it.","Air fry:Preheat the air fryer. Place the chicken on the air fryer basket \/ grate in an even layer, leaving a bit of space for air to circulate around. Air fry the chicken at 415 degrees for 10 minutes. If you have larger pieces of chicken, you\u2019ll want to go closer to 13 minutes. You\u2019re looking for an internal temperature of 165 degrees.","You\u2019re done! Yum!It should be a gorgeous sight for hungry eyes. Crisped on the outside, full of flavor, and juicy to the max. Let it rest for a moment; then slice into it and enjoy. We often eat at least half of it just hot out of the air fryer while standing over the cutting board. I am on a kick with dunking the chicken pieces in a house-made gochujang dipping sauce which is in the notes below!"],"7":["Make Your Tots:Follow package directions for a bag of frozen tator tots. The soup doesn\u2019t take too long so I usually like to do this first (they usually take 20-30 minutes).","Cook the onions and garlic:Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven. Add onions and garlic; saut\u00e9 until nice and fragrant, about 5-10 minutes.","Add spices:Add green chiles, spices, and salt. Give it a minute to get nice and yummy.","Add everything else:Add beans, chicken, broth, sour cream, cream, and cornstarch slurry. Simmer until slightly thickened.","You\u2019re Done!Top each bowl of soup with a pile of seasoned tots, some cilantro and green onion, and a shot of hot sauce if you want. Absolute delight."],"8":["Roast the mushrooms:Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Toss the sliced mushrooms with the avocado oil and the seasoning on a sheet pan until well-combined. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.","Make the horseradish aioli:Mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl until well-combined. Taste and season.","Assemble the sandwiches:Toast the bread for the last few minutes on the pan with the mushrooms. Split the bread, spread with pesto rosso, roasty mushrooms, havarti (pop it in the oven again for a minute if you want it to melt), arugula, and the top piece of bread shmeared with the horseradish sauce. OH MY WORD can you even? This is so good."],"9":["Cook the mushrooms and garlic:Melt the butter over medium heat. Add sliced mushrooms; saut\u00e9 until golden. Once they\u2019re golden, add salt \u2013 this will draw out some of the water. Cook the mushrooms down so some of the water can evaporate. Add garlic and saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.","Make your sauce:Add broth, cream, and thyme. Bring to a simmer and let it cook for 5-10 minutes. Add cornstarch slurry to thicken. (This is a good time to boil your gnocchi if you haven\u2019t already.)","Add your gnocchi: Remove thyme sprigs from the sauce; add Parmesan and stir to melt it in. Add your cooked gnocchi and gently stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper; add additional broth if needed to keep the sauce nice and silky.","You\u2019re done! Yum.Scoop hot, steamy, saucy gnocchi into bowls, top with Parm, salt, and pepper, and enjoy your life."],"10":["Prep everything:Chop, measure, get everything all set up first.","Brown the beef:Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Toss the cut beef chunks with salt. Add the beef to the pot and let it cook, undisturbed, for a few minutes on each side until it gets nice and browned. You may need to do this batches depending on the size of your pan. Remove beef chunks and transfer to the slow cooker.","Saute onions and garlic:Add onions and garlic (and a bit more oil if needed); saut\u00e9 until golden and softened. This process should lift a lot of yummy browned bits from the bottom of the pan.","Add spices:Add the brown sugar and spices; saut\u00e9 for 3-5 minutes until nice and fragrant.","Add tomatoes and chiles:Add green chiles and crushed tomatoes; simmer for 3-5 minutes until bubbly and delicious.","Cook low and slow:Pour tomato mixture into the slow cooker over the beef chunks; gently nudge them around so they are surrounded in the sauce. Cook on high for 4-ish hours or low for 8 hours.","Serve:Shred the beef into big tender chunks (you should be able to do this directly in the slow cooker) and season with more salt to taste. Serve with sour cream, cheddar, green onions, and cornbread."],"11":["Make the Tomato Soup:Put the tomatoes, butter, and onion in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring it up to a low bubble, then turn the heat to medium low. Cover partially with a lid; let it simmer for 45 minutes. Stir every 15 minutes or so to prevent scorching on the bottom.","Remove Onion Chunks:Remove the onion pieces using tongs. I leave the garlic in there, but that\u2019s up to you!","Blend the Tomato Soup:Using an immersion blender, blend up the soup until it\u2019s a smooth as you want it. Taste and adjust; you can thin it out with milk, water, broth, cream, whatever you want; I just leave it as-is!","Serve:Serve tomato soup with garlic bread, grilled cheese, croutons, crackers, pesto, whatever you like!"],"12":["Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.","Soften the butter in the microwave in short increments. I like to whisk it to get it smoothed out a bit.","Grate the garlic directly into the butter. Add the garlic powder, Parmesan, and parsley; stir to combine.","Cut the French bread in half and spread with the butter mixture (this amount of butter is good for half of one large French bread loaf \u2013 see photos above).","Bake for 9-10 minutes in the middle of the oven, adding an extra 1-2 minutes or bumping to 425 at the end for more browning.","Remove from the oven, cut into slices, and serve. Life is good."],"13":["Make Muffin Batter:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Whisk oil and sugars. Add pumpkin, vanilla, eggs, and milk; whisk until just combined. Add flour, baking soda, spices, and salt; mix until just combined. Pour muffin batter into an oiled or nonstick muffin tin, filling about 3\/4ths of the way to the top of each up.","Make Cinnamon Sugar:Mix up the cinnamon sugar topping in a small bowl.","Assemble and Bake:Spoon the cinnamon sugar over each muffin. Bake for 20-24 minutes, or until the tops spring back when gently pressed.","Make Maple Cream Cheese Filling:Add the cream to a small bowl and beat until light and fluffy and stiff peaks form. In a separate bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Fold in the whipped cream, using the beaters again to smooth it out if needed. Add the maple syrup and mix until smooth.","Fill The Muffins:Once the muffins have cooled, cut a cone out of the center of the muffins using a small paring knife. Using a piping bag, or a plastic bag with the corner snipped off, add the filling to the center hole in the muffins. Fill it all the way to the top (the filling will be exposed at the top \u2013 cute).","Serve:These are ready to eat as-is! If making ahead, they should be stored in the fridge. They can be eaten at room temp or cold \u2013 both delicious!"],"14":["Heat a nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add your cheese in a ring shape.","Once it starts to melt a little bit, crack an egg directly into the center.","Spoon a bit of roasted corn around the edge of the egg.","Use a spatula to pull the edges in a bit once the cheese starts to get golden brown; you don\u2019t have to do this, but I find that it helps to contain the egg a bit and expose those golden brown lacy edges.","Cover and let it cook for a minute or two.","When the egg is cooked to your liking (I prefer it with the whites set and the yolk still a bit runny), transfer the egg to tortilla with refried black beans.","Finish with pickled onions, cilantro, Cotija, and your sauce of choice. The crispy cheese edge. The runny yolk. The creamy beans, spicy sauce, tangy onions. Oh my word. YUM."],"15":["Chimichurri:Blitz up your sauce in a food processor. It will be somewhat emulsified and it will settle a bit as it rests. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, finely chop everything and mix together in a bowl. Divide the sauce into three bowls: one bowl for tossing with the shrimp, one bowl for brushing while cooking, and one bowl for brushing at the table.","Get That Flavor on Your Shrimp:Thaw shrimp (if frozen) and remove shells and tails (if necessary or desired). Pat dry with paper towels. Toss the shrimp with one third of the chimichurri.","Grill the Skewers:Thread the saucy shrimp onto soaked wood skewers. Transfer to a grill pan, grill, or standard saut\u00e9 pan over medium high heat. Add the shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, depending on the size of your shrimp. Brush with additional sauce as you cook. Cook until no longer translucent, or until 145 degrees.","Serving:I like to toss some cherry tomatoes with a spoonful of my reserved chimichurri and then plate it all up: rice, tomatoes, shrimp, and a little side dish of tzatziki just for something extra to dip and dunk."],"16":["Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Pour the orzo, vegetable broth, tomato soup, meatballs, and tomatoes into a 9\u00d713 baking dish. Stir to get everything coated and combined.","Bake for 25 minutes. Give it a little stir and check the texture. If needed, bake for another 10 minutes to let the orzo finish absorbing the liquid. Fluff up the orzo with a fork and stir in any remaining liquid that might be bubbling around the edges. This will gently break down the tomatoes and release some of their juices as well. (As the orzo sits, it will continue to absorb liquid so add more tomato soup or broth as desired.)","Add the Parmesan, garlic, and butter; stir to melt it in. Top with fresh basil leaves, olive oil, salt, and pepper."],"17":["Chop stuff:Shred up your kale and brussels. You can keep these in containers in the fridge to assemble salads throughout the week! Chop your nuts and apples and set aside. (Toss the apples with a few drops of lemon juice if you don\u2019t want them to brown.)","Make your shallots:Fry the shallots in a bit of oil in a skillet until golden and crispy, or fry them in the microwave using the method in the notes section.","Fry the bread cheese:Cube and fry the cheese in a nonstick over medium heat until golden brown and delicious.","Assemble:Toss kale, brussels, apples, cashews, shallots, cheese, and dressing together. Salad happiness! Enjoy!"],"18":["Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms; saut\u00e9 until softened and yummy. Add garlic for the last minute or two of saut\u00e9ing.","Add the frozen wontons, chicken broth, and teriyaki sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes, with a lid on, until the wontons are heated through.","Finish with remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, chili crisp, and top with sesame seeds and scallions."],"19":["Make the Spicy Cashew Sauce:Blend all ingredients in a high-powered blender until very smooth.","Prep the Chicken:Cut the chicken breasts into very thin pieces. Toss with the cornstarch, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.","Cook the Chicken:Add the avocado oil to a nonstick pan over medium high heat. Add the curry paste and brown sugar; cook for a few minutes to get it caramelizy and bubbly. Add the chicken. Toss once to coat in the sauce, then let it sit for several minutes to get the chicken nice and golden brown. Flip and repeat until chicken is cooked through. If needed, add 1-2 tablespoons of water to the pan to lift up any browned pieces that are stuck to the bottom.","Serve:Serve the chicken on cooked rice, with cooked broccoli, with a lot of that yummy cashew sauce all over everything."],"20":["Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.","Mix all ingredients in a blender until a chunky batter comes together.","Pour batter into a greased or lined muffin tin. Sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until the tops gently spring back when you press into them.","Sprinkle warm muffins with sea salt if you\u2019re into that kinda thing.

Bring to a low simmer and let it bubble gently until it\u2019s incorporated and slightly thickened, 3-5 minutes (you don\u2019t want to overcook it or it will get too thick). Remove from heat.","Prep the Dough:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the biscuits into 6 even pieces (half, then into thirds). Toss the biscuit pieces with cinnamon and sugar. Transfer to a round 9-inch cake pan or baking dish.","Assemble:Pour most of the pumpkin caramel over the biscuits until mostly covered. Set aside the remaining 1\/4 to 1\/2 cup caramel for topping.","Bake:Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, let rest for just 2-3 minutes and then invert onto a serving plate.","Optional Topping:Melt the white chocolate and coconut oil in the microwave in 15 second increments, stirring in between. Once melted, drizzle over the monkey bread. Drizzle with reserved pumpkin caramel (optional). Serve warm."],"22":["Preheat the broiler \u2013 I use the \u201cLow Broil\u201d setting but every oven will be different for which setting works best.","Pulse the nuts in a food processor until finely chopped. Set aside a few spoonfuls of the nuts for topping. Mix the remaining nuts, butter, and brown sugar together in a small bowl.","Toast the English muffins on a baking sheet lined with foil until toasty \u2013 about 3 minutes.","Spread English muffins with the nutty butter mixture.

Finish with extra nuts and honey. Pour yourself a cup of coffee to go with it. OMG, it\u2019s so good!"],"23":["Make the Roasted Peanut Vinaigrette:Blend all ingredients in a small blender or food processor until smooth. (This is mostly to incorporate the garlic, so if you\u2019d rather, you can grate the garlic into the jar with the other ingredients and shake thoroughly to combine.)","Prep the Salad:Chop your herbs, peanuts, and fresno peppers.","Chop the Kale and Cabbage:Using a food processor, pulse the kale and cabbage in batches until it is very finely chopped, stopping before the greens get too mushy. If they release too much water, just give them a gentle squeeze with a paper towel.

Add peanuts, peppers, and the rest of the dressing. YUM!"],"24":["Blend all ingredients in a food processor or blender until smooth-ish.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cream the butter, honey, orange zest, and salt with an electric mixer. Add the eggs and mix until well combined (for me, the mixture looked a little funky at this point primarily because the honey does not incorporate with the butter the same way sugar would, but things started to look more normal as the flour was added).","Add the flour and baking powder.

At 10 minutes, flip each piece and bake for another 10 minutes (so total bake time for the chicken is about 20 minutes).","Meanwhile, as your chicken bakes, pulse all the sauce ingredients in a food processor. This is optional, but to help the sauce develop its flavor and thicken a bit, you can put it in a skillet over medium low heat and let it simmer for a while. Prepare your broccoli by boiling for 1 minute and plunging into ice water (it stays so bright green and crispy!) or stir frying until tender crisp.","When the chicken is done, dip each piece in the sauce and return to the baking sheet. Bake another 5 minutes, re-dip for one last sauce love, and let rest for a minute or two.
